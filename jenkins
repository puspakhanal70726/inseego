There are example configurations in the Git repository.

You can fiddle with JSONPath here. You may also want to checkout the syntax here.

You can fiddle with XPath here. You may also want to checkout the syntax here.

You can fiddle with regular expressions here. You may also want to checkout the syntax here.

If your job is not parameterized, then the resolved variables will just be contributed to the build. If your job is parameterized, and you resolve variables that have the same name as those parameters, then the plugin will populate the parameters when triggering job. That means you can, for example, use the parameters in combination with an SCM plugin, like GIT Plugin, to pick a branch.

 	Post content parameters	
Add
If you want value of param1 from post content { "param1": "value1" } to be contributed, you need to add $.param1 here.	
 	Header parameters	
Add
If you want value of header param1 to be contributed, you need to add "param1" here.	
 	Request parameters	
 	Request parameter	
BRANCH
Name of request parameter	
 	Value filter	
Optional. Anything in the evaluated value, matching this regular expression, will be removed. Having [^0-9] would only allow numbers. The regexp syntax is documented here.

Add
If you want value of query parameter param1 to be contributed, you need to add "param1" here.	
 	Token	
3fe50075bae57cac561beb28c836687c-test-magenta
Optional token. If it is specified then this job can only be triggered if that token is supplied when invoking http://JENKINS_URL/generic-webhook-trigger/invoke. It can be supplid as a:
Query parameter /invoke?token=TOKEN_HERE
A token header token: TOKEN_HERE
A Authorization: Bearer header Authorization: Bearer TOKEN_HERE
 	Cause	
Generic Cause
This will be displayed in any triggered job. You can use the variables here to create a custom cause like "$name committed to $branch", if you have configured variables named name and branch.	
 	Silent response	
Avoid responding with information about triggered jobs.	
 	Print post content	
Print post content in job log.	
 	Print contributed variables	
Print contributed variables in job log.	
Optional filter
 	Expression	
Regular expression to test on the evaluated text specified below. The regexp syntax is documented here.	
 	Text	
Text to test for the given expression. You can use any combination of the variables you configured above.	
This is an optional feature. If specified, this job will only trigger when given expression matches given text.
